In this question, you could have servers that are replicated across datacenters.
Availability zones expand the level of control you have to maintain the availability of the applications and data on your VMs. Availability Zones are unique physical locations within an Azure region. Each zone is made up of one or more datacenters equipped with independent power, cooling, and networking. To ensure resiliency, there are a minimum of three separate zones in all enabled regions. The physical separation of Availability Zones within a region protects applications and data from datacenter failures.
With Availability Zones, Azure offers industry best 99.99% VM uptime SLA. By architecting your solutions to use replicated VMs in zones, you can protect your applications and data from the loss of a datacenter. If one zone is compromised, then replicated apps and data are instantly available in another zone.

C. a content delivery network (CDN)
D. an Azure Traffic Manager profile",C,"The question states that users are located worldwide and will be downloading large video files. The video playback experience would be improved if they can download the video from servers in the same region as the users. We can achieve this by using a content deliver network.
A content delivery network (CDN) is a distributed network of servers that can efficiently deliver web content to users. CDNs store cached content on edge servers in point-of-presence (POP) locations that are close to end users, to minimize latency.
Azure Content Delivery Network (CDN) offers developers a global solution for rapidly delivering high-bandwidth content to users by caching their content at strategically placed physical nodes across the world. Azure CDN can also accelerate dynamic content, which cannot be cached, by leveraging various network optimizations using CDN POPs. For example, route optimization to bypass Border Gateway Protocol (BGP).
The benefits of using Azure CDN to deliver web site assets include:
- Better performance and improved user experience for end users, especially when using applications in which multiple round-trips are required to load content.
- Large scaling to better handle instantaneous high loads, such as the start of a product launch event.
- Distribution of user requests and serving of content directly from edge servers so that less traffic is sent to the origin server.",0

Azure Functions abstracts away the underlying servers, storage, and networking, and allows developers to focus on their code and business logic.

As a FaaS model, Azure Functions allows developers to write and deploy small, event-driven functions that automatically scale and run in response to incoming events or triggers. These functions are billed based on their execution time and the resources used during that time.

Therefore, Azure Functions is an example of a cloud service that can be classified as both a PaaS and a FaaS model, depending on the context in which it is being used.
